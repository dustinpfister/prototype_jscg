<h1>This is a JSCG site!</h1>

<p>This is some static content that will always be served up even it you have javascript disabled! Ahh nothing like good old faction reliable static content right? However what if you want a system where in order to have all of the content javaScript must be enabled, and some checks need to be prefromed? This is where JSCG comes in handy.</p>

<p id="p1" class="jscg-locked">(check gated content, please enable javaScript to view)</p>
